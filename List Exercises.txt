# Create two lists to slice, the first is a numeric list from 1 to 9 (List A).
# The second is also a numeric list, from 0 to 9 (List B)

A = list(range(1,10,1)) # start,stop,step
B = list(range(9))

print("This is List A:",A)
print("This is List B:",B)


1. Exercise 1: Retrieve the first two elements from List A
Solution: print("The first two elements of A:",A[0:2], A[:2])


2.Exercise 2: Retrieve the last element of B with a negative number
Solution: B[-1]

3.Exercise 3: Retrieve 4,5,6 from A in two ways: using postive and negative number indices
Solution: 
print("Reading from left: ", A[3:6])
print("Reading from right: ", A[-6:-3])

4.Exercise 4: Go through list A from beginning to end in steps of 2.
print("Going through A in steps of 2 starting from first to last element: ", A[::2])


5.Exercise 5: Go through list A from the last to the first element in steps of 2

print("Going through A in steps of 2 starting from the last element: ",A[::-2])
